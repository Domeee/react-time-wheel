# React Timewheel

Fork of [react-mobile-picker](https://github.com/adcentury/react-mobile-picker) rewritten in React and styled with SCSS. While react-mobile-picker is a basic implementation of a picker, react-timewheel tries to be as close as possible to the behavior of the native browser implementation of the iOS date picker.

Demo: https://react-time-wheel.firebaseapp.com/
